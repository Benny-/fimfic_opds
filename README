Introduction
============
Pathagar is a simple bookserver serving OPDS feeds.
One can add books via the admin interface, as well as
via CSV files, through the command
  python manage.py addbooks

Format of CSV file
==================
The format of the CSV file is like:
"Path to ebook file","Title","Author","Description"
We are working on adding support for more fields in the CSV
file - feedback on this would be very welcome :-).

Quickstart
==========
* Install Django (we are primarily using 1.1 to develop Pathagar.
  YMMV with other versions)

* In the Pathagar folder edit settings.py to suite your needs and
  environment.

* In the Pathagar folder, run
    python manage.py syncdb
  You will be asked to create an admin user during this stage.

* To run the server, run
   python manage.py runserver
  This starts a server listening on localhost, port 8000

* With your browser, access http://localhost:8000 and see if the index
  page comes up. If it comes up, click on "Add books" in the footer to
  start adding books. You will be asked for a username/password. This is
  the admin username/password you supplied while running syncdb.

  NOTE: You can also mass add books via the command line through CSV files

* To run the server in a production environment, look at Django deployment
